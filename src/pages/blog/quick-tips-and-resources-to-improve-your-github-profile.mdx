import { Code } from 'astro/components';
import Heading from '@components/blog/Heading.astro';
import Image from '@components/blog/Image.astro';
import Paragraph from '@components/blog/Paragraph.astro';
import Link from '@components/blog/Link.astro';

export const components = { h2: Heading, p: Paragraph, a: Link };

Unless you have been living under a rock for the past few months, you are probably aware that Github has a cool new feature where you can create a custom markdown README intro for your Github profile page.

I finally got around to creating my initial implementation and wanted to share some quick tips and resources I came across while doing it.

## Getting Started?

For getting started or finding new ideas and inspiration, you can't go wrong with an awesome-\* repository!

Repository: <Link href="https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme" isExternal><span>awesome-github-profile-readme</span></Link>

I highly recommend going through various examples and gathering inspiration from multiple sources.

To see the markdown implementation of a profile click into the README.md file and click the "Raw" version shown in the image below:

	width="750px"
	height="296px"
	alt="Github raw text editing example"
/>

Once you have an idea of the direction you want to go you can get started!

## Emojis

You will quickly notice that emojis are all over the place in almost all the examples you will find.

Most emojis are supported in markdown and you can find a full reference list:

## Displaying Your Dev.to Blog Posts

Luckily there is already a great blog post that goes over this:

<Link
	href="https://dev.to/gautamkrishnar/show-your-latest-dev-to-posts-automatically-in-your-github-profile-readme-3nk8"
	isExternal
>
	<span>Show your latest dev.to posts automatically on your GitHub profile readme</span>
</Link>

## Video Resources

These videos go over various features that can be added to your README including displaying blog posts, YouTube videos, Github stats, icons, badges, currently playing Spotify songs, and more!

## Bonus

You might notice that a lot of examples will have no space in between the emoji and the text:

<Image
	src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/msze24ujavr75opxnqnt.png"
	width="470px"
	height="150px"
	alt="Github profile using emojis example"
/>

To manually inject spaces in between the two you can add `&nbsp;` spaces:

<Code
	lang="ts"
	code={`
	- :computer: &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a full-stack software developer.
	- :briefcase: &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently working on...
	`}
/>
