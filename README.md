Michael Gee's personal portfolio & blogging website.


## Introduction
Built with Next.js & React with a heavy emphasis on UI and responsive design.

Continuously improving this along with my [MG Sandbox](https://github.com/michaelgee22/mg-sandbox) project to build and learn new things to then share my experiences with others.

## Feedback
Feedback is always welcome in any form whether it is positive or negative. Please feel free to open an issue, create a pull request, or even contact me directly if you find any issues or ways you think the project can be improved.

## Social
Always looking to connect with software (currently web) developers so follow my socials if interested!
